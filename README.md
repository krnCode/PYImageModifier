# Image Modifier

## Description

This is a small python script that automatically puts filters in your photos.

The idea came when I thought about changing my wallpapers with some filters, so instead of trying to change one by one, applying only one filter at a time, I thought about creating a script that applied all the filters that I liked in the Pillow module and then saving the modified wallpapers in a new folder.

It also rename the files to include the filter applied.

It was made using Pillow 7.1.2, but you can see it in the requirements file with all the other modules used to make this script.

## Notes

So, for this script to work you'll need to specify where are the folder containing the pics you want to modify. After that, you can specify the path of the folder where the modified pictures will be saved. There's no need to create the folder, since the script can create it for you __*(remember to put the path of the modified pictures folder you want, so it can create it!)*__

Also, there's a filter in the script that is commented out because personally I didn't liked it. But you can uncomment those lines and it should create a new pic with that filter (EMBOSS).

## Closing

I'm new to python and programming in general, and now I'm making little scripts so I can get better at it. Feel free to suggest new things to add, and I'll se what I can do.

And you can share some knowledge too!
